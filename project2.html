            <p> This project was initiated to addresses the challenges faced
                by wild animals and humans due to animal-human interactive
                accidents in wild animal crossing zones. Many drivers struggle
                to spot these dangers, particularly
                on roads near forests characterized by darkness, dense
                vegetation, and sudden turns. The system works by
                alerting drivers and other travelers to potential dangers
                posed by wild animals. Utilizing a combination of machine
                learning, deep learning algorithms, and image processing
                techniques, the ACZM mechanism leverages a vast open-source
                dataset to identify animals. Through convolutional neural
                networks (CNNs), the model autonomously learns to predict
                objects in every frame captured by live cameras. When an
                object is classified as an animal, the system proceeds to
                identify the species, extract relevant details, classify it
                into groups, and output comprehensive information.
